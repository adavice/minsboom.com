					<h4>Billing</h4>
					<p>The membership fee for our service will be <a href='https://minsboom.com/?page=subscriptionterms' >billed on a monthly basis</a> to your Payment Method on the calendar day, corresponding to the commencement of your paid membership. This is to ensure that all users have uninterrupted access to the website. In some cases the timing of your billing may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month. If you have prepaid for a month and then decide to terminate your VIP membership, the membership will continue until the end of the prepaid period.<br/>

				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Payment Methods</h4>
					<p>If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not change your Payment Method or cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have obtained a valid Payment Method. You authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</p>
				</article>

					<p>While minsboom.com always ensures proper and timely delivery of prizes and welcome gifts etc., these must be approved prior to shipment. All participants who are eligible to receive a welcome gift or have won a prize will be sent a confirmation e-mail where they will be asked to fill out and validate(*) their information so that minsboom.com can ensure the delivery of the gift/prize and discourage cheating. This includes uploading a national insurance card, utility bill, driving license or passport which will be compared to the information entered and, then approved in the system.

				</article>
				<article>

The customer is responsible for this charge. If a welcome gift is returned to our office due to non-delivery, all rights to the gift are forfeited and the gift will not be shipped again.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>E-mail</h4>
					<p>minsboom.com will not be held responsible for non-receipt of the order confirmation e-mail, welcome e-mail, newsletter etc. It is the responsibility of the user to verify that these e-mails have not landed in their 'Junk Mail' or 'Spam' folder, or that the user’s e-mail provider does not block e-mails sent from minsboom.com. Please note that MSN accounts such as Hotmail, Live and MSN may have trouble receiving e-mails from minsboom.com. We therefore recommend the use of other e-mail providers than the aforementioned for communication with minsboom.com.
